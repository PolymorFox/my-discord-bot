# My Discord Bot

This is a discord bot that I made using [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Feel free to use it on your own personal server if you want to, even though it's pretty simple.

## Requirements

- Python
- Pip
- discord.py

## Usage

```
bot.py --token <your api token>
```
